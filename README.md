1. alter [config.js](./config.js) to add your worldbuilding and agents
2. agents inside an array are considered a team, they share the same day report and story for that day
3. call `passDay` to generate reports of what happened in each agent life

Today agents only know about thir own reports and worldbuilding string. One improvement to be made is making them interact with other agents around the same region of the world.
